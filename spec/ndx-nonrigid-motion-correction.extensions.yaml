    doc: A mapping function of pixels onto basis variables. To be fully general, this
      is a sparse matrix (AxBxC) (number of voxels in each of the spatial dimensions).
      In standard blockwise motion correction, this matrix is a matrix of ones. In
      CNMF's patches, this matrix is a labels each non-overlapping patch with a unique

    doc: A set of (NxM) basis variables where N is the number of blocks, M is the
      number of spatial dimensions (1 to 3) each defined for a set of times T (for
      the number of time-steps). In standard block-wise motion correction, N = 1,
      in line-by-line motion correction, N = number of lines, in CNMF's non-rigid
      motion correction, N = number of patches
